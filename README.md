## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This was a great little project on seeing how close to pixel perfect I could get by using just HTML and vanilla CSS.
I hadn't used much svg images before, so getting to use them here was a treat.Especially in regards to using one as a hero image at the top of this component and rounding out the top left and right corners.
